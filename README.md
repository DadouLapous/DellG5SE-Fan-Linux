# DellG5SE-Fan-Linux
The Dell G5SE-5505 laptop isn't working with usual fan managers, this script is a small utility to automatically set fan speed according to cpu and gpu thermals.
## Requirements
This is a python script, you'll need python, and the `sys`, `os`, `time` python libraries.
You will also need to modprobe the dell smm kernel module, which is not loaded by default on this laptop.
```shell
# modprobe dell-smm-hwmon restricted=0 ignore_dmi=1
```
If you want this setting to stay upon reboot, you can create a / replace by or append to the config file  `/etc/modules-load.d/dell-smm-hwmon.conf` 
```shell
dell-smm-hwmon
```
and the same for `/etc/modprobe.d/dell-smm-hwmon.conf` 
```shell
# This file must be at /etc/modprobe.d/
options dell-smm-hwmon restricted=0 ignore_dmi=1
```
## Usage
```shell
# python DellG5SEFan.py lowtemp maxtemp timer
```
For instance, 
```shell
# python DellG5SEFan.py 50 65 10
```
will disable fans for temperature below 50째C, put fans at 50% between 50째C and 65째C and at 100% over 65째C, with a 10 second loop.

:warning: Be careful ! Too high temperatures can permanently damage your hardware.

## Todo
- [ ] Make a config file
  - [x] Service on boot via systemd
  - [ ] Live update on temp changes in config file
- [ ] Core 
  - [ ] Different temp threshold for enabling disabling to avoid repeated fan switches, or put a sleep timer after a fan change.
  - [ ] change argument parsing
    - [ ] non verbose mode
    - [ ] default setup
    - [ ] help menu
- [ ] Depending on if the script takes too much hardware ressources, switch to another language.
- [ ] Once the config file is done and the script can live-update the parameters, add a gnome extension to update config file.
- [ ] Tell me
